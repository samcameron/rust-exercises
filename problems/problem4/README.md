# Problem 4

`problem4` has us take a vector of string slices and print out a nicely
formatted flower box, e.g.:

```
**********
* this   *
* is     *
* a      *
* flower *
* box    *
**********
```

## lib.rs

The function definitions are all broken this time, but there are tests
in the docs and in the test module. Run `cargo test --package problem4`
to run them all.

## Docs relevant to this problem

The entire `Understanding Ownership` chapter covers references, borrowing, and slices:
